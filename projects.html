      <button class="accordian">▽ Raspberry Pi</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>In January 2024, I bought my first Raspberry Pi, and since then I have been using it to self-host a wide
          variety of services that replace proprietary apps that I use every day. All of the apps and services I
          run are docker compose stacks for ease of use and security.
          <br>
          <br>
          For instance, I decided to move away from using Google's password manager and instead serve my own
          password manager using Vaultwarden, which is a Bitwarden compatible server that you can host yourself.
          <br>
          <br>
          Other services I run include a VPN, a Minecraft server for me and my friends, Nextcloud for file storage,
          a CouchDB database to sync my university notes for free, and a reverse proxy
          so that I can safely expose these services to the internet without having to use a VPN at all times.

      <button class="accordian">▽ Learning Linux</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Since the Pi runs Raspberry Pi OS, which is Debian based, I had to learn some Linux commands
          to manage it and install programs. I ended up liking it so much that I transitioned to using
          Linux on my laptop, replacing Windows for my day-to-day tasks.</p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordian">▽ The Odin Project</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>In my spare time, I have been going through an open source full stack web development course.
          <br>
          <br>
          I am currently around 90% of the way through the Foundations course, which goes over an
          introduction to HTML, CSS and some basic JavaScript. It also requires users to learn how to
          use Git in order to manage and version our work, which has been really helpful in my work
          even outside this course. This website has been created using knowledge gained by doing this
          course!
          <br>
          <br>
          Once I have finished the Foundations course, I will continue learning the Full Stack JavaScript
          path.
