# My Website

This is the repo for my first ever website, handwritten in HTML and CSS without the use of any AI or vibe-coding tools.

You can visit this site on GitHub Pages [here.](https://sam-horry.github.io/personal-site/index.html)

## Inspiration

For this website, I was heavily inspired by Alex Dimitrov's Portfolio for Developers, which I found on Figma [here](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1417555189581721037).
